### CSE 248 - Algorithmic & Optimization Foundations for VLSI/CAD with Prof. CK Cheng

Description: Algorithmic techniques and optimization frameworks for large-scale, difficult optimization problems. IEEE International Roadmaps for Devices and Systems and the implications; hypergraph partitioning (e.g., ratio cuts, spectral partitioning, ancestor trees); 2D/3D floorplanning (e.g., sequence pairs, corner block lists,  twin binary trees, ordered trees); discrete and analytical placement;  interconnect routing via primal-dual multicommodity flow approximations; standard-cell library layout generation; and applications to other formulations (e.g., graph visualization). Students will conduct homework and projects to explore new formulations and solutions.

Required Knowledge: Basic circuit theory, discrete math

Enforced Prerequisite: None, but CSE 241A is recommended.

Recommended Preparation for Those Without Required Knowledge: Browse the book CMOS VLSI Design 4e: A circuits and systems perspective by Weste et al.
