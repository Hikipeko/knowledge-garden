##### New Spectral Methods for Ratio Cut Partitioning and Clustering

Spectral clustering

##### A graph placement methodology for fast chip design

* A deep reinforcement learning approach to chip foorplanning
* In under six hours, our method automatically generates chip foorplans that are superior or comparable to those produced by humans in all key metrics
* Develop an edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferable representations of the chip.
