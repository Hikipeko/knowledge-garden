##### New Spectral Methods for Ratio Cut Partitioning and Clustering

Spectral clustering

##### A graph placement methodology for fast chip design

* A deep reinforcement learning approach to chip foorplanning
* In under six hours, our method automatically generates chip foorplans that are superior or comparable to those produced by humans in all key metrics
* Develop an edge-based graph convolutional neural network architecture capable of learning rich and transferable representations of the chip.

##### Machine Learning Applications in Physical Design: Recent Results and Directions

##### SpecPart: A Supervised Spectral Framework for Hypergraph Partitioning Solution Improvement

* 2023, 3 citations, ABK
* SOTA uses multilevel paradigm, but has limitations
	* Rely on local structure without considering the global structure
	* Refinement can stagnate on local minima
* First supervised spectral framework that tackles two limitations
* Leading partitioners hMETIS and KaHyPar
