### Abstract

* Cast the analytical placement problem equivalently to training a neural network.
* Achieve over 30x speedup compared to speedup in global placement and legalization without quality degradation compared to [[2018 RePlAce Advancing Solution Quality and Routability Validation in Global Placement|RePlAce]].

### 1 Introduction

* Build an open-source generic analytical placement framework.
* Propose efficient GPU implementations of key kernels in analytical placement.
* Demonstrate over 30x speedup in global placement and legalization without quality degradation.
