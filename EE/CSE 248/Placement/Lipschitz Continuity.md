> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity

A strong form of uniform continuity for functions. A Lipschitz continuous function is limited in how fast it can change: there exists a real number such that, for every pair of points on the graph of its function, the absolute value of the slop is not greater than this real number. The smallest such bound is called the *Lipschitz constant* of the function.
