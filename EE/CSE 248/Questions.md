### Homework 

* Question 3
	* Edge cost 0? Vertices cost?
	* Just partition, or partition with retiming?
	* In "Performance driven partitioning using retiming", the problem is simplified in that a path is cut at most once, and each loop is not cut, does this apply to the question?
	* Is this an open question?
* Question 4
	* Any limitation on partition size?

### Project

* Office hour to discuss?
* Choose partition as our project?
	* Why the research on partition is not as popular in the past 10 years?
	* The implementation in industry is already pretty mature good enough?
	* What are some of the unsolved problems or open question for partition problem?
	* What are SOTA approaches?
	* View on "SpecPart: A Supervised Spectral Framework for Hypergraph Partitioning Solution Improvement"
	* Have some idea on partition or 
* Choose placement?
	* ePlace, any future works?
