### 1 Introduction

![[Pasted image 20231010213155.png|500]]

* Identify the roadmap of electronic industry from devices to systems and from systems to devices.
* EUV technology will support the continuation of metal half-pitch scaling well until around 8 nm by the end of this decade.
* Vertical transistors and nanoribbons are progressively entering the logic technology arsenal
* This vision for the year 2030 and beyond (quantum computing) is supported by IRDS and the IEEE International Network Generations Roadmap.

#### 1.2. THE NEW ECOSYSTEM OF THE ELECTRONICS’ INDUSTRY

* Sales of PCs and notebooks had been declining since 2011. However, the pandemic has seen a multitude of new users reversing this trend.
* sales of smart phones skyrocketed from about 122 million in 2007 (year of introduction) to 1.5 billion units in 2017 and maintained this unit sale level in subsequent years.
* Clock frequency limited to less than 10GHz by power wall.
* This means that this year (2022) the semiconductor industry will transition in the 12 nm technology generation according to the correct definition of technology node.
* More and more layers required multiple exposures practically doubling the number of masks in some cases.
* In order to limit power values, it was no longer possible to increase operational frequency beyond 10 GHz and therefore faster transistors no longer translated into to a higher operating frequency. Semiconductor companies concentrated the transistor design effort on reducing power.
* It is however possible to fully reconnect with the historical definition of technology node defined by NTRS/ITRS if the value of the metal half pitch is once again used to identify a technology generation
* There is still a lot of room to run for scaling as a contributor to increasing transistor density.
* The key limiting factor in building any computing or communication system remains the speed of communication between logic and memory chips. It is well known that most of the total computing time is spent in memory.
* The combination of 3D scaling both monolithically (SoC) and heterogeneously (SiP) will enable compacting more and more devices in a well-defined area/volume according to Moore’s Law for another couple of decades.
* Beyond 3D: store more than one bit in a single memory cell.

### 2 Roadmap Process and Structure

* The mission of the Application Benchmarking (AB) IFT is to identify key application drivers, and to track and roadmap the performance of these applications for the next 15 years.
* It is anticipated that logic technologies will transition to 3D approaches in the next few years.

### 3 Overall Roadmap Drivers -- ORSC and ORTC

* Nowadays multiple new architectures are being explored and especially tailored for specific applications. (multiple cores)
* The IRDS formulates and harmonizes system and device requirements in a comprehensive and synergistic way. 

### 4 Grand Challenges

* a transition from FinFET to gate-all-around (GAA) will start and potentially a transition to vertical nanowires devices will be needed

### 5 Historical Evolution of the Roadmap Methodology and its Effect on the Electronics Industry

* No longer does a faster microprocessor trigger the design of a new PC but on the contrary the design of a new smart phone generates the requirements for new ICs and other related components.
* Develop many new architectures each capable of delivering better solutions to specific problems
* Performance of computation can be increased by translating repeating software instructions into hardware (specialized cores)
* Therefore, it is expected that a combination of SoC and SiP will become the dominant technological approach to increase system performance by cost effectively augmenting the integration complexity of novel ICs and packaging solutions.
* All these somewhat dissimilar technologies have been readily included into mobile appliances by means of ==heterogeneous integration==.
* All the above considerations indicated that the structure of integrated circuits needed to evolve from 2D to 3D structures and transistor design needed to be aimed at reduced power consumption as opposed to be optimized for maximum operating frequency.

### 6 Practical Considerations

* These GAA MOSFETs will be stacked monolithically to be 3D VLSIs.
* In summary a combination a combination of transistor improvements and 3D IC integration will provide complementary ways of improving overall system performance, as illustrated in Figure ES59

### 7 The Challenge of Quantum Computing

* Superconducting quantum computing requires further development, lower error rates, and scale up (number of qubits) to clearly demonstrate the improved performance of important applications.

In next five years, instead of pursuing 2D physical limits, the potential of shorter pitch process, multicore architecture, 3D structured transistors, 3D VLSI, SoC, SiP technologies will extent Moore's Law.
