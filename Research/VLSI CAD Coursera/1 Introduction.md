##### Background

* Computer science: programming, data structure
* Computer engineering: basic digital design (Kmaps), combinational and sequential design
* Mathematics: discrete, graph theory, continuous
* Basic VLSI knowledge: some chip layout exposure

##### CAD for semi-custom ASICs

* **ASIC**: application-specific integrated circuit
* **Semi-custom**: try to design ==reusing== some already designed parts. Full-custom is hardly used.
* **CAD**: Computer-Aided Design, flow through a sequence of design steps and software tools. Currently referred to as ==EDA==, Electronic Design Automation.
* **SOC**: System on Chip, integrated many blocks of function on one big chip

##### CAD Flow

* Synthesis steps: go forward, make new stuff
* Verification steps: go backward, check that it worked

Logic Synthesis -> Logic Verification -> Layout Synthesis -> Timing Verification

##### Syllabus

* Computational Boolean algebra
* Logic verification
* Logic synthesis
