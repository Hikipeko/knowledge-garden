#### 3.2.1 Wafer Formation

#### 3.2.2 Photolithography

* "Carving picture in stone using light"
* Define the minimum *pitch* (width + spacing) of a process to be $2b$.
* The resolution depends on wavelength $\lambda$ and the *numerical aperture (NA)* of the lens: $2b = k_1 \frac{\lambda}{NA}$
* The numerical aperture is $NA = n \sin \alpha$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium.
* The *depth of focus* is $DOF = \frac{k_2\lambda}{NA^2}$

* Individual devices in a CMOS process nee to be isolated from another
* *Shallow trench isolation (STI)* forms insulating trenches of SiO2 surrounding the transistors.
