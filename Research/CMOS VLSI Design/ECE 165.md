[[CMOS VLSI Design]]
### 1 Introduction

##### Content

* Analysis
* Simulation: with Cadence Spectre simulator, standard tool in industry
* Layout
* Verification

##### Computing Environment Cadence Design Systems

* 45nm CMOS Process
* Simulations using Spectre/Hspice
* Layout using Virtuoso
* Functional synthesis using Verilog

* Integrated circuits are fabricated on wafers

##### History

* ENIAC, the first electronic computer! (1946)
* The transistor revolution in Bell Labs! (1948)
* The first integrated circuit, integrate many transistors onto one substrate! (1957)
* Intel 4004 Micro-Processor with 2000 transistors, 1 MHz! (1971)
* Intel i9-12900K has ~21 billion transistors, 5.2 GHz!

##### Classes of ICs

* Microprocessor: medium configurability, 
* FPGA: field-programmable gate array: high configurability
* ASIC: low configurability, high speed or low power, specialized hardware
* Memory
* VLSI: millions of transistors

##### Designers

* Microprocessors: Intel, AMD, Apple, Qualcomm
* Memory: Samsung, Hynix, Micron
* Graphics: Nvidia, AMD, ATI
* FPGA: Xilinx, Altera

##### Design Abstraction Levels

##### Trends

* Multi-core
* Control of cores
* Low-voltage operation, e.g. dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
* Multiple transistor Vt (trade off between switching power and leaking power)

Circuit design hides the "bad" behavior of the transistor from the concern of the programmer.
