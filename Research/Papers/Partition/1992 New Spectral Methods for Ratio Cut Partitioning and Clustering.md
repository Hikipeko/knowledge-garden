### Abstract

The second smallest eigenvalue of a matrix derived from the netlist gives a provably good approximation of the *optimal* ratio cut partition cost. (TODO: need citation to Towards efficient hierarchical designs by ratio cut partitioning)

### 1 Preliminaries

Partitioning is basic to many CAD problems, packaging of designs, clustering analysis, partition analysis for high-level synthesis.

##### A Basic Partitioning Formulations
