5. Security in Context

#### The Security Mindset

Security studies how systems behave in the presence of an **adversary**, an intelligence that actively tries to cause the system to misbehave.

The *security mindset* encourages thinking about how attackers could cause system to fail, in order to head off problems before they are exploited.

##### Think Like An Attacker

* Look for weakest links
* Identify assumptions security depends on
* Think outside the box (e.g. software could be attacked via hardware vulnerabilities)

##### Think as a Defender

* Security polices: what properties are we trying to enforce (confidentiality, integrity, etc.)
* Threat modeling: who are we defending against
* Assessing risk and selecting countermeasures

#### Course Mechanics

Complete a brief quiz before the next lecture. Contribute on Piazza.

* Participation 5%: complete quiz before the next lecture + contribute on Piazza
* Projects 45%: 5 projects in total
* Lab 5%: submit via Autograder.io (==Strick lateness policy==)
* Midterm 15% 2/23 19:00-20:30 in person
* Final 30% 4/21 19:00-21:00 in person, cover the entire course

##### Security Ethics

Don't be evil, practice attacks only on systems we give you to test.
