# Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the art of "secret writing."

-   Historic ciphers, and perfect secrecy.
-   Symmetric encryption, including pseudorandom generators, stream ciphers, pseudorandom functions/permutations.
-   Message authentication.
-   Cryptographic hash functions.
-   Public key encryption.
