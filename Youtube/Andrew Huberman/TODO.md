- Eye movements during REM sleep are erratic and can be observed by pulling back eyelids

- REM sleep is characterized by the absence of serotonin and norepinephrine

- It is also characterized by atonia, or paralysis

- This has implications for dreaming and learning during REM sleep

\8. Paralysis & Hallucinations

- REM sleep is a stage of sleep where our eyes are moving but the rest of our body is paralyzed and we are hallucinating

- Adrenaline (epinephrine) is not released during REM sleep, which is important for adjusting our emotional relationship to challenging things that happened to us while we were awake

- Dreams during REM sleep can involve replays of things that did occur, as well as elaborate contortions of things that didn't occur, and can include social anxiety, being late to an exam, or being naked in public

- Nightmares can occur during REM sleep and can carry a lot of emotion, sometimes leading to waking up in a panic

\9. Nightmares

- Nightmares are likely to occur during slow-wave sleep

- Drugs can give people scary or eerie dreams

- Common dream is feeling of paralysis and being chased

- Intense, fearful memories are unlikely to occur in REM sleep

- Some people experience waking up feeling very stressed

\10. When REM & Waking Collide

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

that I happen to be thinking about or dreaming about in the moments before. And that's an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into the waking state, and the moment you wake up, epinephrine is available. So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,

\11. Sleeping While Awake

- Nightmares are likely to occur during slow-wave sleep

- Thoughts and ideas from REM sleep can invade the waking state

- People may experience waking up and being paralyzed, which can be terrifying

- This paralysis can also be accompanied by hallucinations

- Alien abduction experiences have core characteristics that map closely to this phenomenon

\12. Alien Abductions

- Slow-wave sleep early in the night is important for motor learning and detail learning.

- REM sleep has a dream component with no epinephrine, resulting in vivid dreams with no anxiety.

- Learning in REM sleep is not motor events, but rather unlearning of emotional events.

- Not getting enough REM sleep can lead to a variety of issues.

\13. Irritability

- Easily falls asleep but wakes up around 3-4am

- Uses a Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol to relax body and brain and fall back asleep

- Sleeps until 7am and gets a lot of REM sleep

- Lack of REM sleep can make people emotionally irritable

\14. Sleep to Delete

- REM sleep is important for emotional regulation and forming relationships with rules and algorithms.

- During REM sleep, spatial information from the day is replayed, allowing us to remember important information and forget unimportant information.

- Meaning is formed by piecing together experiences from the day.

\15. Creating Meaning

- We have an agreed upon association with computers and information and memory, but not with pens.

- REM sleep is important for solidifying relationships and discarding irrelevant meanings.

- Sleep deprivation can lead to odd associations and hallucinations.

- Over-emotionality or catastrophizing can occur if we link the web of our experience.

\16. Adults Acting Like Children

- It is important to have narrow channels between individual things in order to have healthy emotional and cognitive functioning.

- REM sleep has the capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter.

- REM sleep is similar to clinical practices designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma.

\17. Trauma & REM

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

are a death in the family or of a close loved one, something terrible that happened to you or somebody else, or an entire childhood or some event that in your mind and body is felt as and experienced as bad, terrible, or concerning. Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatment such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, or ketamine treatment for trauma, something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine at kind of a core level bear very similar features to REM sleep. So let's talk about EMDR first. EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, is something that was developed by a psychologist, Francine Shapiro.

\18. EMDR

- A woman was walking in the forest behind Stanford and noticed that her emotional load was lessened

- She developed a practice of having her clients and patients move their eyes from side to side while recounting a traumatic event

- This practice is now approved by the American Psychological Association for the treatment of trauma

- The decision to use lateralized eye movements was made for practical reasons, such as confidentiality and weather

- The eye movements look silly but involve sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side

\19. Demo

- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a clinical tool used to help people dissociate the emotional experience of particular traumas.

- Eye movements of the sort used in EMDR have been shown to suppress the activity of the amygdala, which is involved in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear.

- EMDR is most successful for single event or very specific kinds of trauma, such as car crashes, and should be done in a clinical setting with a certified practitioner.

- Ketamine is a new chemical treatment that bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.

\20. Ketamine / PCP

- Ketamine and PCP are dissociative anesthetics that disrupt the activity of the NMDA receptor in the brain.

- NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience and can trigger a cellular process called long-term potentiation.

- Long-term potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later, intense events are not needed for the neuron to become active again.

\21. Soup, Explosions, & NMDA

- Neurons become active and create a connection between an experience and an emotion

- Ketamine is used to prevent this connection from forming, and is used in emergency rooms to prevent intense emotions from being attached to traumatic experiences

- EMDR and REM sleep are also used to suppress the amygdala and remove emotionality from experiences

- All of these interventions are designed to act like therapy and remove emotion from experiences

\22. Self Therapy

- Slow-wave sleep is important for motor learning and detailed learning

- REM sleep is important for attaching emotions to experiences and unlearning emotional responses

- Mastering sleep is important for managing disruptive events

- Sleep disturbances correlate with emotional and psychological disturbances

- Menopause can have emotional effects on the brain

\23. Note About Hormones

- Menopause is related to disruptions in temperature regulation and sleep regulation, which can impact emotionality.

- Sleep deprivation can affect energy, immune function, and self-induced therapy.

- EMDR and ketamine therapies are in-clinic therapies, while REM sleep is self-induced.

- It is important to know how to get and ensure the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep.

\24. Measuring REM / SWS

- Devices such as the Oura Ring and Whoop band can be used to measure the quality and depth of sleep.

- Feeling rested and learning can be used to gauge sleep.

- A study by Emily Hoagland found that regularity of sleep is more important than total duration.

- Variations in total sleep time can affect learning.

\25. Sleep Consistency

- Limiting the variation in the amount of sleep is more important than just getting more sleep overall.

- Consistently getting the same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep.

- For every hour variation in sleep, there is a 17% reduction in performance on exams.

- Strive for a regular amount of sleep.

- Avoid drinking a lot of fluid right before going to sleep.

\26. Bed Wetting

- Having a full bladder can disrupt sleep and cause bedwetting in children.

- Drinking a lot of water before bed can help with dream recall.

- Neurotransmitters shift during REM sleep, leading to less serotonin.

- Supplements can be taken to improve sleep.

\27. Serotonin

- Taking tryptophan or 5-HTP can lead to deep sleep, but can also disrupt the timing of REM and slow-wave sleep.

- Low levels of serotonin are associated with slow-wave sleep.

- There are ways to increase slow-wave sleep, such as taking supplements.

\28. Increasing SWS

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning, is to engage in resistance exercise. It's pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone, which happens early in the night. And resistance exercise, therefore, can induce a greater percentage of slow-wave sleep. It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime. In fact, for some people, the exercise can be disruptive for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes. But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise, does seem to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, which, as we know, is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine, detailed information, not general rules or the emotional components of experiences. For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming

\29. Lucidity

- Set a cue before going to sleep, such as writing down a statement or drawing a picture of something you'd like to experience in a dream

- Lucid dreaming does not have to involve altering features of the dream, but can simply be the awareness that you are dreaming

- Find the right amount of sleep for you and try to get it consistently night to night

- Wake up at the end of an ultradian cycle (6 hours) rather than in the middle (7 hours)

\30. Booze / Weed

- Alcohol and marijuana can induce pseudo sleep-like states

- Consumption of alcohol and THC can disrupt the pattern, depth, and sequencing of sleep

- Arginine may increase the amount of slow-wave sleep

- Keeping a sleep or dream journal can be useful for exploring dreams

\31. Scripting Dreams

- Keeping a dream journal can help people recall their dreams

- Dreams can be associated with either REM or slow-wave sleep

- Theory of mind is a concept that can help distinguish between REM and slow-wave sleep dreams

- Writing down dreams can help people learn more about their dreams

- Dreams can sometimes be recalled in the mid-morning or afternoon

\32. Theory of Mind

- Theory of Mind was introduced by Simon Baron-Cohen, brother of comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen

- Theory of Mind tests are done on children to assess autism

- Theory of Mind is associated with emotional learning and social interactions

- Theory of Mind is often present in REM-associated dreams

- Dreams in REM sleep are associated with emotional unlearning of life events

\33. Synthesis

- Slow wave sleep is important for motor learning and details, while REM sleep is associated with intense experiences and emotion uncoupling.

- Consistency of sleep is better than getting different amounts of sleep each night.

- Tools for improving sleep quality include morning and evening light, blue blockers, supplements, and measuring sleep duration and quality.

- Hot and cold showers can have certain benefits.

\34. Intermittent Sleep Deprivation

- We all experience lack of sleep from time to time and should not catastrophize it.

- Aim to get a consistent amount of sleep and use non-sleep deep rest protocols to help relax.

- There are many tools available to help with sleep, most of which are free.

- Apologies for any snoring from Costello, the 10-year-old bulldog mastiff.

\35. Snoring Disclaimer

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years. So I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, but after he's gone, there won't be any snoring, although I'll probably get a different dog. So sort of a, what would the kids say? Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry about the snoring. And I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely, but he's here for the haul. So that's what that's about. As we close out this segment on sleep,

\36. New Topic

- Moving into a new theme and topic for the next four to five episodes: Neuroplasticity

- Neuroplasticity is the defining feature of the nervous system and what makes us us as individuals

- Exploring learning in childhood, adulthood, sensory plasticity, motor plasticity, language acquisition, emotional acquisition, and childhood attachment

- Discussing supplements, chemicals, machines, and devices to assist in speeding up the plasticity process

- Supporting the Huberman Lab podcast by subscribing, leaving comments and questions, rating, suggesting to friends, and checking out sponsors

\37. Corrections

- Testosterone is made by the Leydig cells of the testes, not the Sertoli cells

- Misspoke and meant to say 98.6 instead of 96.8 when discussing average temperature

- Temperature varies a lot across the day and night

- Apologize for the error

\38. Closing Remarks

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

of the nervous system in biology and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness. It's really an incredible landscape to consider. And I hope that you're getting a lot out of the information. As always, thank you for your interest in science. And I'll see you next time.

\2. Plasticity: What Is it, & What Is It For?

- Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability to change itself in response to experience.

- It can occur in response to traumatic events, positive events, or any other type of experience.

- Neuroplasticity is a feature of our biology that allows us to think differently, learn new things, and adapt to life.

- It is a natural process that we are all born with and can be accessed through tools and biological principles.

\3. Babies and Potato Bugs

- Babies are born with crudely wired brains and nervous systems, with many connections that are not precise

- These connections are like small roads, with no highways

- As we mature, certain connections are reinforced and strengthened while others are lost

- Developmental plasticity from birth to age 25 is mainly a process of removing connections that don't serve our goals well

- Positive and negative events during this period can also affect the development of the brain and nervous system

\4. Customizing Your Brain

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

are really stamped down into our nervous system in a very dramatic fashion by what we call one trial learning. We experienced something once and then our nervous system is forever changed by that experience. Unless of course we go through some work to undo that experience. So I want you to imagine in your mind that when you were brought into this world, you were essentially a widely connected web of connections that was really poor at doing any one thing. And that through your experience, what you were exposed to by your parents or other caretakers, through your social interactions, through your thoughts, through the languages that you learn, through the places you traveled or didn't travel, your nervous system became customized to your unique experience. Now, that's true for certain parts of your brain

\5. Hard-Wired Versus Plastic Brains

- Many aspects of the nervous system are designed to be non-plastic and reliable, such as those that control heart rate, breathing, and digestion.

- Other aspects of the nervous system are quite easy to change, and the young brain is particularly primed for learning.

- Children can learn language quickly and easily, and can even create new combinations of words they have never heard before.

- After age 25, the brain's plasticity begins to decline.

\6. Everything Changes At 25

- After age 25, different processes are needed to make changes to the nervous system that will stick.

- Fire together, wire together is true for early development, but not after age 25.

- After age 25, specific processes must be engaged in to change the brain.

- These processes are gated, meaning changes cannot be made without going through a series of steps.

- Connections in the nervous system are refined from birth to age 25 through strengthening and removal of connections.

\7. Costello and Your Hearing

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

I just want to acknowledge that Costello is snoring particularly loud today. Some of you seem very keen at picking up on his snoring. Others of you can't hear his snoring. It's very low rumbling sound. And whether or not you can or you can't probably relates to the sensitivity of your hearing. We're actually going to talk about perfect pitch today and range of auditory detection. And so if you can hear Costello's snoring, enjoy. If you can't, enjoy. I want to talk about how the nervous system changes. What are these changes? Many of us have been captivated by the stories in the popular press about the addition of new neurons.

\8. The New Neuron Myth

- After puberty, the human brain and nervous system adds very few, if any, new neurons.

- Neurogenesis (the process of adding new neurons) can occur in rodents and some non-human primates in areas such as the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

- In humans, neurogenesis can occur in the olfactory bulb, but evidence is more controversial for other areas of the brain.

\9. Anosmia: Losing Smell

- Being hit on the head too hard can cause axons from olfactory neurons to be sheared off, leading to anosmia (inability to smell).

- Olfactory neurons can regrow connections and even add new neurons to the olfactory bulb.

- This regrowth is possible from birth to age 15.

- It is unclear if new neurons can be added to the hippocampus.

\10. Neuronal Birthdays Near Our Death Day

- Terminally ill cancer patients were injected with a label, a dye that is incorporated only into new neurons.

- After these patients died, their brains were harvested and there was evidence for new neurons.

- However, the number of new neurons added to the adult brain is infinitesimally small.

- Neural circuits can create new connections and add new functions, including new memory, new abilities, and new cognitive functions.

- This is done through making connections between neurons, making them stronger and more reliable, as well as removing connections.

\11. Circumstances for Brain Change

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

to say moving through a grieving process or removing the emotional load of a traumatic experience. So even though we can't add new neurons throughout our lifespan, at least not in very great numbers, it's clear that we can change our nervous system, that the nervous system is available for change, that if we create the right set of circumstances in our brain, chemical circumstances, and if we create the right environmental circumstances around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode in which change isn't just possible, but it's probable. As I mentioned before,

\12. Brain Space

- The child nervous system is characterized by change and the ability to easily sample different connections.

- As we age, the extracellular space between neurons is filled up by extracellular matrix and glial cells, making it harder to change connections.

- Plasticity can be achieved at any stage of life through deficits and impairments in sensory apparati.

- Examples include people born without a nose and olfactory structures in the brain, who cannot smell.

\13. No Nose, Eyes, Or Ears

- Areas of the brain that normally represent smell can become overtaken by areas of the brain involved in other senses like touch, hearing, and sight.

- In individuals that are blind from birth, the occipital cortex (visual cortex) can become overtaken by hearing.

- There was a tragic incident of a woman who was blind since birth and had a stroke that took out most of the function of her visual cortex, leaving her unable to braille read or hear.

- Most people do not end up in this highly unfortunate situation, and blind people can use their visual cortex for braille reading and hearing.

\14. Enhanced Hearing and Touch In The Blind

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity, meaning they can sense things with their fingers and they can sense things with their hearing that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able to. In fact, you will find a much greater incidence of perfect pitch in people that are blind. And that tells us that the brain, and in particular this area we call the neocortex, which is the outer part, is really designed to be a map of our own individual experience. So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth, or maybe has a limb development impairment where they have a stump instead of an entire limb with a functioning hand, their brain will represent the body plan that they have,

\15. Brain Maps of The Body Plan

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

not some other body plan. But the beauty of the situation is that the real estate up in the skull, that neocortex, the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience. Now, it is true, however, that if let's say I were to be blind when I'm 50, I'm 45 right now, I've always been sighted. If I was blind at 50, I'll probably have less opportunity to use my formerly visual cortex for things like braille reading and hearing because my brain has changed. It's just not the same brain I had when I was a baby. So there's actually a principle of biology,

\16. The Kennard Principle (Margaret Kennard)

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

not many people know this, it's actually a principle of neurology, which is called the Kennard principle, which says if you're going to have a brain injury, you want to have it early in life. Of course, better to not have a brain injury at all, but if you're going to have it, you want to have it early in life. And this is based on a tremendous number of experiments examining the amount of recovery and the rate of recovery in humans that had lesions to their brain either early in life or later in life. So the Kennard principle says better to have injuries early in life. Now, that's reassuring for the young folks, it's not so reassuring for the older folks, but there are aspects of neuroplasticity

\17. Maps of Meaning

- We all have a mental map of the world around us, including a map of emotional experience and trustworthiness.

- A woman in a course told the speaker that his tone of voice reminded her of someone she had a bad experience with.

- The speaker and the woman became friends over the course of the two weeks, and the woman found his voice more tolerable.

- Recognizing something can help make it more tolerable.

\18. Awareness Cues Brain Change

- Our nervous system has two broad sets of functions: reflexive and learned

- The first step in neuroplasticity is recognizing that you want to change something

- We must be deliberate and know what it is we want to change

- Self-recognition mechanisms are neurochemicals that help us identify what we want to change

\19. The Chemistry of Change

- Neurochemicals help to stamp down particular behaviors, thoughts, and emotional patterns.

- When we are consciously aware of a change we want to make, chemicals are released in the brain to allow us to make those changes.

- Specific protocols must be followed for the changes to occur.

- Self-recognition is the forebrain signaling the rest of the nervous system to pay attention to something.

\20. A Giant Lie In The Universe

- People often say that experiences change the brain, but this is not true unless the person is a young child.

- Neuroplasticity is based on the release of certain neurochemicals that strengthen or weaken the connections of neurons.

- Two individuals are credited with the basis of neuroplasticity, although many more people were involved in the work.

\21. Fathers of Neuroplasticity/Critical Periods

- David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel conducted experiments in the 70s and 80s recording electrical activity in the brain's visual cortex.

- They studied how vision works and how the visual brain organizes features of the visual world.

- They explored how vision is affected by conditions such as cataracts, lazy eye, and strabismus.

- They found that the visual brain rewires itself if clear vision does not occur during a critical period.

- Experiments in other sensory systems followed up on their work, showing that the brain is a customized map of the outside world.

- They won a Nobel Prize for their work.

\22. Competition Is The Route to Plasticity

- The amount of activity for a given part of the body is competing for space in the brain, meaning that if we want to change our nervous system in adulthood, we need to give up something else.

- David and Torsten conducted an experiment where they closed one eye, and found that there was a huge change in the brain.

- Changes in the brain occur through strengthening and weakening of particular connections, such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and spike timing dependent plasticity.

- To change the brain, we need to bring an immense amount of attention to whatever it is that we want to change.

- David and Torsten won a Nobel prize for their work, which unveiled the mechanisms of brain change and plasticity.

\23. Correcting The Errors of History

- The critical period was the idea that if the nervous system was deprived of an input, it could never be changed unless intervened early.

- Ophthalmologists use this idea to fix lazy eyes and cataracts in young children.

- In the early 90s, Greg Reckonzone and Mike Merzenich tested this idea and found that it wasn't entirely true.

\24. Adult Brain Change: Bumps and Beeps

- Experiments have proven that the adult brain can change, provided certain conditions are met.

- Subjects in experiments had to pay attention to subtle differences in order to complete tasks.

- Plasticity in the brain was observed when subjects paid attention to the task, not when they paid attention to an auditory cue.

- Experiences do not necessarily change the way the brain works.

\25. What It Takes to Learn

- Experiences that you pay careful attention to open up plasticity in the brain.

- Merzenich and his team found that the answer lies in a neurochemical response.

- This response allows us to change our brain at any point in our lifespan for anything we want to learn.

- This includes subtracting emotions, building a greater range of emotion, learning new information, motor skills, and cognitive-motor skills.

- The neurochemical response is the same as the chemical of stress.

\26. Adrenalin and Alertness

- Epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is released from the brainstem region called locus coeruleus when we are in high states of alertness.

- Epinephrine increases the likelihood that neurons will be active.

- Alertness alone is not sufficient for neuroplasticity; acetylcholine must also be released.

- Hubel and Wiesel's research showed that plasticity in response to certain experiences is only possible when awake.

- Listening to something while asleep does not lead to learning.

\27. The Acetylcholine Spotlight

- Acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain: the parabigeminal nucleus in the brainstem and the nucleus basalis in the forebrain.

- Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight, amplifying the signal of a particular input and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

- Epinephrine and acetylcholine released from both the brainstem and the forebrain are necessary for plasticity.

\28. The Chemical Trio For Massive Brain Change

- Stimulating the release of acetylcholine from nucleus basalis can lead to rapid, massive learning in one trial.

- This has been shown by Merzenich, Kilgard, and Weinberger.

- It is a fundamental principle of how the nervous system works.

- Repetition can be important, but the way to use repetition to change the brain is different.

- Accessing epinephrine and acetylcholine from two sources can lead to changes in the nervous system.

\29. Ways To Change Your Brain

- In episode one of the Huberman Lab podcast, various ways to monitor and change the nervous system were described, including brain machine interface, pharmacology, and behavioral practices.

- Combining behavioral practices with pharmacology and brain machine interface is an untapped capacity.

- To access plasticity, epinephrine (alertness) is needed, which can be achieved through a good night's sleep and a cup of coffee.

- Refer to episodes two, three, four, and five of the Huberman Lab Podcast for more information on sleep and how to get better at sleeping.

- Engaging in deliberate focused alertness is in direct proportion to how well one is sleeping on a regular basis.

\30. Love, Hate, & Shame: all the same chemical

- People use psychological tactics to create accountability for themselves

- Tactics can be shame-based or out of love

- Brain does not distinguish between emotions when releasing epinephrine

- Key is to identify multiple reasons for wanting to make a change

\31. The Dopamine Trap

- Being motivated to not be afraid, ashamed, or humiliated for not achieving a goal is important.

- Accessing dopamine while working towards a goal can have positive effects.

- Beware of positive reinforcements that may prevent you from achieving a goal.

- Ask yourself what is driving you to accomplish a goal.

- Smartphones and devices can create an attention deficit.

- Learn how to create depth of focus using neuroscience principles.

\32. Nicotine for Focus

- Nicotine binds to the nicotinic receptor, which is involved in attention and alertness.

- A Nobel prize winning colleague chews Nicorette to increase focus and offset Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

- Alpha-GPC and choline are supplements that can increase cholinergic transmission in the brain.

- Examine.com provides a list of supplements and dangers associated with cholinergic transmission.

- Some people use cholinergic drugs to increase their level of focus.

\33. Sprinting

- Sprinters take cholinergic agents to increase focus and reaction time

- Acetylcholine is the molecule that controls nerve to muscle contraction

- Chewing Nicorette, smoking cigarettes, and taking supplements are not recommended ways to increase acetylcholine

- Increasing focus is the best way to increase acetylcholine

\34. How to Focus

- Mental focus follows visual focus, and can be improved by increasing visual focus.

- Alertness is the key to accessing neuroplasticity.

- Caffeine and Adderall can be used to increase alertness.

- Sense of love, joy, or fear can also increase alertness.

- Reasonable amounts of caffeine can be used safely.

\35. Adderall: Use & Abuse

- Adderall is an amphetamine that increases epinephrine release from the locus coeruleus, making people more alert

- It is prescribed for certain clinical syndromes, such as attention deficit, but has a high probability of abuse

- Adderall does not increase focus, but increases alertness

- It can be habit-forming and learning on Adderall does not always translate to high performance off or on Adderall

- The acetylcholine system and the focus it brings is available through pharmacology

\36. Seeing Your Way To Mental Focus

- Visual focus is a trade-off between looking at a small region of space with a lot of detail and precision, or looking at a larger area with less detail.

- Focus in the brain is anchored to the visual system.

- Animals with eyes on the side of their head use avergence eye movement to focus on a small cone of visual imagery.

- When eyes move inward, it triggers the release of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.

- Practicing visual focus can help improve mental focus.

\37. Blinking

- Blinking more often is a sign of fatigue

- Blinking resets our perception of time and space

- Blinking is necessary to lubricate the eyes

- Mental tricks, pharmacology, caffeine, and hydration can increase alertness

- Visual focus is the primary way to deploy neurochemicals

- Experiments have been done to test learning without vision

\38. An Ear Toward Learning

- Closing the eyes is one of the best ways to create a cone of auditory attention.

- Low vision or no vision folks have tremendous capacity to focus their attention in particular locations.

- Asking someone to look you in the eye while also asking them to listen to you is one of the worst ways to get them to listen.

- Two animals with the best hearing in the world are not mentioned.

\39. The Best Listeners In The World

- Elephants have the best hearing of any animal, due to their large ears.

- Moths also have good hearing, which explains why they are hard to catch.

- People who are non-sighted have better pitch than those who are sighted.

- To focus on something, one must devote their attention to it and feel some agitation due to epinephrine in the system.

- Great musicians like Stevie Wonder and Glenn Gould orient one ear or side of their head to the keys on the piano.

\40. Agitation is Key

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and you're feeling like you're not doing it right, chances are you're doing it right. And you can practice this ability to stare for long periods of time without blinking. I know it's a little eerie for people to watch, but if your goal is to learn how to control that visual window for sake of controlling your focus, it can be an immensely powerful portal

\41. ADHD & ADD: Attention Deficit (Hyperactivity) Disorder

- People can give themselves low-grade ADHD or ADD due to the way they use their phones.

- Visual motion stimuli can be more engaging than reading words on a page.

- People should be careful not to devote all their neurochemical resources to passive experiences.

- It is important to focus on challenging tasks to engage the cholinergic system for plasticity.

- Consider how often you focus on something and how good you are at focusing on challenging tasks.

\42. Ultra(dian) Focus

- Learning bouts should last about 90 minutes

- Give yourself permission to not be fully focused in the early part of the bout

- Eliminate distractions by turning off Wi-Fi and putting phone in another room

- Maintain visual focus on the thing you're trying to learn

- Attention will drift, but re-anchor it by bringing it back

- Increase focus and learning rate by maintaining visual focus

\43. When Real Change Occurs

- Neuroplasticity occurs during sleep, not wakefulness.

- Focusing on something for 90 minutes or more can lead to neural circuit strengthening and knowledge acquisition.

- Poor sleep after learning can still lead to knowledge acquisition if sleep is achieved the following night.

- Non-sleep deep rest and brief naps can accelerate learning.

- Plasticity in childhood is achieved by being a child, and plasticity in adulthood is achieved by engaging alertness, focus, and non-sleep deep rest and deep sleep.

\44. How Much Learning Is Enough?

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

I always get asked how many bouts of learning can I perform? I know people that train up these visual focus mechanisms to the point where they can do several 90-minute bouts throughout the day, as many as three or four. And some of them are also inserting non-sleep deep rest as well. Now that can get pretty tricky. A lot of people find that they can recover best from these intense bouts of focused learning by doing some motor activity,

\45. Learning In (Optic) Flow/Mind Drift

- Self-generated optic flow (e.g. walking, running, cycling) can create a state of non-sleep deep rest.

- Focused bouts of learning followed by wordless activities can accelerate learning and depth of learning.

- Areas of the brain like the amygdala, which are involved in releasing epinephrine, shut down in this state.

- Scientific data supports the benefits of this type of activity, as seen in the Cell Reports paper.

\46. Synthesis/Summary

- Plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan, with early exposure to sensory events creating plasticity.

- To learn as an adult, one must be alert and know when they are most alert in their 24-hour cycle.

- Attention can be learned and is critical for creating plasticity.

- Acetylcholine can be increased pharmacologically or through visual focus.

- Learning is best done in 90-minute bouts, with deliberate disengagement and deep sleep accelerating plasticity.

\47. Learning With Repetition, Forming Habits

- There are two types of plasticity: one that involves intense focus and emotionality, and one that involves repetition and reward

- To engage in plasticity, one should focus on hard or difficult events, rest, and sleep

Expand All|Collapse All

\1. Introduction

- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, discussing science and science-based tools for everyday life

- Sponsors of today's podcast include Headspace, Athletic Greens, and Made For

- Headspace is a meditation app, Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink, and Made For is a behavioral science company

- Discussion focuses on how to change the nervous system for the better through motor commands and aspects of movement and balance

- Protocols and tools discussed are based on scientific literature and tailored to individual needs and goals

\2. Nerves and Muscles

- The brain and nervous system control behavior through two categories of neurons: lower motor neurons and upper motor neurons.

- Lower motor neurons live in the spinal cord and send electrical signals to the muscles.

- Upper motor neurons reside in the motor cortex and send signals for deliberate action.

- Central pattern generators in the brainstem control repetitive patterns of movement.

- Plasticity can be leveraged to access changes to emotional experience, belief systems, and memory.

\3. Exercise alone won’t change your brain

- Exercise is beneficial for cardiovascular function, strength, and bone density, but does not open plasticity.

- Behavior can change the brain, but only if it is different enough from existing behaviors.

- To open plasticity, certain things must be done in addition to exercise.

\4. Behavior will change your brain

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

And the answer is yes, provided that behavior is different enough from the sorts of behaviors that you already know how to perform. And I should have added the word well, because you can't obviously perform a behavior that you don't know how to perform because you don't know how to do it yet. But there's a key element to accessing neuroplasticity that frankly, I don't see out there in the general discussion about neuroplasticity. In the general discussion about neuroplasticity and about learning, I hear all these gimmicks about using different ways

\5. Remembering the wrong things

- Memorizing lots of information is not the goal; being selective about what you remember is.

- Adaptive changes are key to accessing neuroplasticity.

- Traumatic brain injury and dementia are topics for a future episode.

- Behaviors that engage neuroplasticity can help you learn or unlearn specific things.

\6. Behavior as the gate to plasticity

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

that we're really talking about learning a bunch of motor movements. You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete. You might want to learn how to dance, you might not. You might want to learn how to dance and get better at remembering and learning languages, for instance, or at unlearning some difficult emotional experience, meaning you want to remove the emotional load from a particular memory of an experience. What we're talking about today is using behavior as a gate to enter states of mind and body that allow you to access plasticity. So let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity that are available to us because those will point directly towards the type of protocols that we should engage in to change ourselves for the better,

\7. Types of Plasticity

- Representational plasticity is the internal representation of the outside world

- We have maps of auditory, visual, and motor space

- Proprioceptive feedback helps us know where our limbs are

- Plasticity is created by mismatches or errors in how we perform things

- Neuroplasticity is created by sending signals

\8. Errors Not Flow Trigger Plasticity

- Neuroplasticity is not achieved through flow, but through the release of certain neurochemicals (acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine).

- Making errors is the signal to the brain that something is wrong and needs to be changed.

- Making errors over and over again is the route to shaping the nervous system to perform better.

- Last episode discussed the principles of neuroplasticity and focus.

- This episode focuses on dopamine and making errors as a signal to the brain to pay attention and change.

\9. Mechanisms of Plasticity

- The brain is incredibly plastic from birth until age 25.

- Passive experience shapes the brain due to chemicals and neuron arrangement.

- Plasticity begins to taper off after age 25 and different mechanisms are needed to engage plasticity as an adult.

- When young, the brain is very plastic but has less control over experience.

- When older, generally, more control over experience is available.

\10. What to learn when you are young

- Get a broad education in a variety of topics

- Find something that captures your passion and put extra effort into it

- Emotional development is important

- Tap into plasticity mechanisms to mark nerve cells for change

- Natural conditions allow for change; supplements, drugs, machines are not necessary

\11. Alignment of your brain maps: neuron sandwiches

- Our nervous system is able to link visual, auditory, and motor spaces by aligning them in perfect register.

- This alignment takes place in the superior colliculus.

- Experiments have revealed that these maps are plastic and can be shifted.

- Eric Knudsen's experiment showed that wearing prism glasses can shift the visual field.

\12. Wearing Prisms On Your Face

- Young individuals can quickly adjust their motor behavior to reach to the correct location when their visual world is distorted by prism glasses or inverted glasses.

- These representational maps can move, shift, rotate, and even flip themselves.

- Plasticity in adults can be achieved by understanding the signal for plasticity, which is not just having prism glasses on.

- The Knudsen Lab and other labs have looked into how to achieve plasticity as adults that mimics the plasticity of juveniles.

\13. The KEY Trigger Plasticity

- Errors signal to the nervous system that something is not working and cause the release of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

- Frustration is an emotional state that the brain does not understand, but the release of epinephrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine can help the brain to focus on the error margin and make changes.

- Young brains are naturally able to make these changes, but older brains may need more practice and patience.

\14. Frustration Is the Feeling to Follow (Further into Learning)

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions. So let me just pause and just say this. If you are uncomfortable making errors and you get frustrated easily, if you leverage that frustration toward drilling deeper into the endeavor, you are setting yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage. But if you take that frustration and you walk away from the endeavor, you are essentially setting up plasticity to rewire you according to what happens afterwards, which is generally feeling pretty miserable. So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is that continuing to drill into a process to the point of frustration, but then staying with that process for a little bit longer, and I'll define exactly what I mean by a little bit, is the most important thing for adult learning

\15. Incremental Learning

- Juveniles can make massive shifts in their map representations quickly

- Adults tend to learn slowly and may not achieve full map shifts

- Incremental learning is essential for adults to make small errors

- Smaller bouts of focused learning are necessary for adults to learn

- Adults can engage in a huge amount of plasticity with incremental learning

\16. Huberman Free Throws

- Motor learning involves making errors in order to access plasticity

- Aim for the point of frustration when learning a motor behavior

- Focus on the desired behavior rather than specific details

- Plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system

- Shorter bouts of intense learning are more efficient for adults than longer bouts

- Errors are necessary to signal plasticity to the brain

\17. Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes

- Incremental learning is about signaling to the nervous system which component needs to change.

- When shooting free throws, there are many different errors that can occur.

- The nervous system will figure out how far off the motor commands are from the desired behavior.

- Short learning bouts (7-30 minutes) are essential for learning an instrument as an adult.

- Plasticity in the nervous system can be achieved all at once as an adult.

\18. Triggering Rapid, Massive Plasticity Made Possible

- The Knudsen Lab revealed that plasticity in adults can be as dramatic and robust as in young people, provided there is a serious incentive for the plasticity to occur.

- The importance of something determines how fast plasticity will arrive.

- Just going through the motions is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.

- The need to change must be crucial enough for the nervous system to change quickly and to a large degree.

- This has relevance for people battling addiction, as it has a biological component.

\19. Addiction

- People can struggle to change their behavior, but it is possible with the right internal belief and desire.

- Knudsen's studies show that incremental learning can create a high degree of plasticity in adults.

- Contingency (i.e. the need to eat or make an income) can also create plasticity.

- There is an underlying neurochemical system that can be tapped into to create change.

- Specific behaviors can liberate particular categories of chemicals to make the most of incremental learning.

- Ultradian rhythms (90-minute cycles) help break up our 24-hour day and sleep into different cycles.

\20. An Example of Ultradian-Incremental Learning

- Ultradian cycles help us learn best in 90-minute cycles

- Learning involves intense focus and repetition of tasks

- Making errors during a 7-30 minute period can help accelerate plasticity

- Learning can also be accelerated when something bad happens

\21. Bad Events

- Negative experiences are wired into us quickly because our nervous system's main job is to keep us safe.

- Negative experiences deploy high levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, making us on the lookout for it.

- Positively surprising experiences or being flooded with dopamine can increase neuroplasticity, motivation, etc.

- Dopamine is released when we think we're on the right path toward an external goal.

\22. Surprise!

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal. I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning

\23. Making Dopamine Work For You (Not The Other Way Around)

- Combining two modes of plasticity (making errors and focusing on learning) can accelerate plasticity.

- Frustration is a cue for epinephrine to be released.

- Subjectively associating the experience of making errors with something good can create a synergy between dopamine and failure.

- Telling ourselves that failures are good for learning and good for us can accelerate plasticity.

- Dopamine can be released by telling ourselves something is good.

\24. HOW to release dopamine

- Dopamine is a highly subjective molecule that is released in response to basic behaviors and activities, as well as what we subjectively believe is good for us.

- Dopamine can be released in response to things like food, sex, warmth, and cool environments.

- The book "The Molecule of More" talks about dopamine not just as a molecule associated with reward, but also motivation and pursuit.

- To maximize learning, make lots of errors and attach dopamine to them, and keep learning bouts relatively short.

\25. (Mental) Performance Enhancing Drugs

- Children learn faster than adults due to their ability to pack more information into their brains and nervous systems.

- Being a child is like being in a performance-enhanced brain milieu due to natural, healthy neurochemicals.

- Advice for young people: learn as much as possible about many things and specialize in something by age 30.

\26. Timing Your Learning

- Find something that excites you and become really good at it

- Identify the times of day when you have the highest mental acuity

- Engage in learning bouts for 7-30 minutes, making errors and seeking frustration

- Find pleasure in the frustration to create an optimal neurochemical milieu for learning

\27. (Chem)Trails of Neuroplasticity

- Brain is in a heightened state to learn and retain information after engaging in a physical activity

- Chemicals released during physical activity can stay in the brain for up to an hour

- Heightened learning state can be used to learn motor patterns, cognitive information, and language information

- Error states can be accessed through physical activity

- These states are not gimmicks, but tap into basic mechanisms of plasticity

\28. The Three Key Levers To Accelerate Plasticity

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

are balance, meaning the vestibular system, as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction or autonomic arousal. And if none of that makes sense, I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those and what it is and why it works for opening up neuroplasticity.

\29. Limbic Friction: Finding Clear, Calm and Focused

- Limbic friction is a term used to describe the feeling of being too alert or too tired

- Stress is not a good word to describe what most people experience as stressful

- To access neuroplasticity, one needs focus, reward, and the ability to make errors

- To calm down, one can use a double inhale-exhale technique or panoramic vision

- To wake up, one can get a good night's sleep, use an NSDR protocol, or use super oxygenation breathing

\30. The First Question To Ask Yourself Before Learning

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and I want to be more alert? You're going to need to engage in behaviors that bring you to the starting line in order to learn. There are other things that you can do in order to then learn better and faster besides incremental learning, and those center on the vestibular system. And this may come as a surprise to some people, but probably not as a surprise to some of you whose professions or whose recreation involves a lot of motor activity and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity, not just running or cycling or very linear activities like weightlifting,

\31. Balance

- The vestibular system is the hardwired system for balance

- It works through three planes of movement: pitch, yaw, and roll

- The semicircular canals in the inner ear contain little stones that roll back and forth to detect movement

- Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience can lead to neuroplasticity

\32. Cerebellum

- Autonomic arousal needs to be at the correct level to start a learning bout

- Limbic friction can cause you to be too tired or too alert

- Disrupting the vestibular motor relationship can release neurochemicals in the brain that make learning easier and more pleasurable

- Flow state is a state of heightened arousal that can help with learning

\33. Flow States Are Not The Path To Learning

- Flow is an expression of what you already know how to do, not how you learn

- Engaging the vestibular system and creating errors can create a neurochemical state that makes you good at learning quickly

- Examples of activities that can help reach this state include inversions, yoga, taking corners faster on a bike, and swimming different strokes

- The key parameter is how regularly you perform a particular motor behavior and how novel it is

\34. Novelty and Instability Are Key

- Novel behaviors in relation to gravity can create plasticity in the body and brain.

- People who are experienced in a certain activity may not experience the same level of excitement as a beginner.

- To create novelty and plasticity, one must explore the sensory motor vestibular space by being in a new position or slightly unstable.

- Examples of activities that can create novelty include yoga, gymnastics, handstands, and biking.

- It is important to stay safe and not put oneself at risk.

\35. How to Arrive At Learning

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal. Clear and focused is best, but don't obsess over being right there. It's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired. Then you want to make errors. We talked about that. And this vestibular motor sensory relationship is absolutely key if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity. And we talked about another feature, which is setting a contingency. If there's a reason, an important reason for you to actually learn, even if you're making failures, the learning will be accelerated. So there's really four things that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult. And I would say that these also apply to young people. And there's an interesting kind of thought experiment there as well, which is if you look at children,

\36. The Other Reason Kids Learn Faster Than Adults

- As we age, we tend to move in more linear and regular ways, reducing our engagement with neuroplasticity.

- Resistance exercise trains nerve-to-muscle connections as much as muscles themselves.

- Engaging the vestibular system in novel ways can safely increase plasticity.

- Surfing is an example of orienting the body differently according to the gravitational pull.

- High contingency activities can also amplify plasticity.

\37. Learning French and Other Things Faster

- Plasticity has limits and cannot be accelerated infinitely

- Brain machine interface technology does not yet exist to download knowledge quickly

- Nootropics can increase focus but should be used with caution

- Behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts can increase plasticity regardless of age

- Incremental learning is powerful

- The vestibular system can open up opportunities for plasticity

- Respect for the yoga community and its practices is acknowledged

\38. Yoga versus Science

- Yoga has many practices with specific names, but no explanation of how they work.

- Science has many mechanisms and publications, but little explanation of tools and practices.

- Goal is to bridge the gap between disciplines, mainly through neuroscience.

- Understanding mechanism allows for flexibility and adaptation to dynamic life circumstances.

- Neuroscience can be powerful in understanding how to access dopamine and adjust limbic friction.

\2. The Daily (Learning) Routine

- Neuroplasticity is the ability of the nervous system to change itself through conscious thought or feedback from another person.

- Today's episode is about how to leverage neuroplasticity and optimize the brain.

- Concrete examples of routines and tools will be shared.

- Everyone is different, but there are common features of the nervous system and body that direct us toward particular practices and routines that can be powerful for neuroplasticity.

\3. Plasticity Is NOT the Goal

- Plasticity is a state or capacity for our nervous system to change, but it is not the goal.

- The goal is to access plasticity and direct it towards particular goals or changes.

- Specific end goals can be very specific (e.g. learning a language) or more general (e.g. being more creative).

- Plasticity is important for continuity in life, but it should not be so robust that we forget who we are each day.

- Leveraging neuroplasticity is not a rule in life.

\4. No Obligation To Change

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

No one said you had to do that. This podcast and this episode is particularly for people who are either happy or unhappy with where they're at, with a particular aspect of their life, and they want to shift it in some positive way. And many of you listening might say, well, wouldn't everyone want to do that? Well, actually, there are a certain number of people that are pretty good where they're at and they don't want to change, and that's terrific. And I tip my hat to them, and I think that's wonderful. If ever they decide that they want to leverage these plasticity mechanisms, they can at any stage throughout the lifespan. Let's start by talking about the different systems

\5. Practical Plasticity Language

- Plasticity in the nervous system can be divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term plasticity.

- Short-term plasticity is any shift that is achieved in the moment or day, but not necessarily held onto forever.

- Medium-term plasticity is changes that are made for a specific purpose, such as learning a language for a vacation.

- Long-term plasticity is changes that are made so that the brain works differently reflexively.

- There are tools and protocols that can be used to achieve long-term plasticity.

\6. Pillars of Neuroplasticity

- Autonomic arousal governs plasticity and all of our life

- High focus and alertness states trigger plasticity and learning

- Deep rest and deep sleep are necessary for reconfiguring brain connections

- Autonomic arousal system wakes us up and makes us alert

- If we cannot access the arousal system or sleep well, we cannot access plasticity and rewire our brain

\7. My Daily Routine: Chronotype Management

- Tend to go to bed too late and wake up tired and groggy

- Natural circadian rhythm is shorter than 24 hours

- Getting light in the late afternoon can help shift the cycle and stay up later

- Neuroplasticity can optimize wakefulness, but need to do something to access it

- Get sunlight in eyes in first 30 minutes of the day to help with circadian clock

\8. Plasticity of the Wake-Sleep Circuit: Morning Light

- Melanopsin cells and the circadian clock have plastic connections throughout the lifespan.

- Astrocytes actively remove and reinforce connections between the eye and the clock every day.

- Viewing light first thing in the morning helps wake up and can prime the connections between the melanopsin cells and the circadian clock.

- Regular light exposure is important to maintain the primed connections.

- Delaying caffeine intake can also help with alertness in the morning.

\9. Delay Caffeine!

- Caffeine suppresses adenosine, making us feel alert

- Delaying caffeine for two hours after waking helps to reinforce the neural circuit between the circadian clock and cortisol release

- This helps to prevent a mid-morning crash and allows for a natural lift in alertness and focus

- Adenosine receptors are left unoccupied, allowing caffeine to be used later in the day

- Sunlight in the morning is a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits

\10. Light, Black Coffee, Hydrate

- Uses bright light to stimulate alertness

- Prefers black coffee for focus

- Hydrates first thing in the morning to reduce headaches and migraines

- Delays caffeine until two hours after waking up

- Caffeine adds more alertness to optimize brain function

\11. High Alertness, Linear Tasks/Learning

- Generally, states of high alertness are great for strategy implementation when we already know how to do something.

- Duration, path, and outcome are the three things that the deliberate conscious brain is trying to figure out in order to perform certain tasks.

- It is not necessary to do the hardest or most critical tasks throughout the day.

- Creativity and tasks related to it come best when we are in states of calm or slightly drowsy.

- Mid-morning is when many people tend to achieve their peak in alertness and focus.

\12. Background Music/Noise: Yay or Nay?

- Background noise can be helpful or distracting depending on the source of the lack of focus.

- If feeling too keyed up, silence and quiet can be helpful.

- Autonomic arousal can be reduced by eliminating background noise.

- Learning is a focus linear task.

- Errors can be made when feeling too keyed up.

\13. “GO” versus “NO-GO”: The Basal Ganglia & Dopamine

- The go-no-go circuit connects the forebrain and the basal ganglia in the brain.

- Dopamine triggers the activation of go and binds to D1 receptors.

- The no-go pathway suppresses action and involves dopamine binding to D2 receptors.

- States of mind and body can facilitate go or no-go.

- This circuit can be applied on a daily basis.

\14. Leveraging GO, NO-GO

- Peak of alertness for the author is between 9.30 and 11 a.m.

- Caffeine should be used cautiously if one is already wide awake.

- Autonomic arousal level determines whether one should listen to music or have complete silence while working/learning.

- Autonomic arousal is determined by the amount of dopamine in the body.

- Good night's sleep can lead to higher levels of alertness.

\15. Non-Specific Action

- When feeling very alert, it is important to be aware of the tendency to take action

- To focus on learning, it is important to shut down internet access and turn off phones

- Use a program like Freedom to lock out of the internet for a particular time

- Disconnect from wireless networks to avoid reactivating it

- In extreme cases, put the phone outside or on the roof to avoid accessing it

\16. Clear, Calm, Focused: The GO, NO-GO Sweet Spot

- Optimal learning state is one with energy and focus to pursue and suppress action

- This is achieved through a push-pull between dopamine one and two receptors in the go and no-go pathways

- Mental fatigue accumulates as pathways become metabolically consuming

- Alertness is key to achieving this optimal learning state

\17. When Very Alert, Work In Silence; When Tired, Include Background Noise

- Silence is the best situation for learning.

- Background noise can help elevate autonomic arousal.

- Salience network is always scanning the environment.

- Stark environments can make people feel calm or anxious.

- High energy people benefit from learning to go and activate the no-go pathway.

- Distractions can be distracting from learning.

\18. Temperaments Vary: And So Should This

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

Now, some people are just naturally more calm. They're like my bulldog Costello, who's exceedingly calm. They're pretty mellow. They're kind of clear, calm and focused all of the time. And those people actually are going to be less flappable. They're not going to be yanked around by background noise or they're not going to be around, you know, bothered from their learning or from their studying by a clanging of a pot from somebody in the kitchen. So each one of us generally tends to ride up and down this autonomic ladder, so to speak, at different times a day. For most people, three hours after waking,

\19. The 3 Hour-Long Post Waking Block

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

those three hours, not three hours on the mark, but that three hour bin tends to be the period in which they're most alert throughout the day, except I'll tell you later about a unique time right before sleep in which you're also very, very alert naturally. So that morning three hours is quite vital. Now, many of you might ask about exercise

\20. Early Morning Exercise and GO Networks

- Research suggests that afternoon exercise may be better for performance and avoiding injury.

- Exercising early in the day triggers the release of epinephrine and other neuromodulators, leading to heightened levels of arousal and mental acuity.

- Exercising within an hour or ideally within the first three hours of waking up can help with energy levels and feeling biased for action.

- Timing of nutrition is important if exercise is very intense, as it can lead to a crash afterwards.

\21. Fasting, Ketogenic Diets, & Food Volume

- Fasted states and low carbohydrate states tend to lead to alertness.

- Eating large amounts of food, regardless of the type, can lead to sleepiness.

- Eating shifts us towards a state of calm, while fasting shifts us towards a state of alertness.

- Drinking black coffee or mate and ingesting a lot of water can help to maintain alertness.

\22. Sodium/Electrolytes

- Salt is a good thing, especially if you're drinking a lot of caffeine

- Drinking salt water first thing in the morning can help with alertness

- Shaky hands and headaches can be caused by low sodium levels

- People who fast may be sodium deficient

- Experiment with salt levels, but only with doctor's approval

\23. Avoiding Hot Lunch, Food Pre-Occupation

- Generally avoids hot food for lunch to avoid feeling sleepy

- Low carbohydrate meal with meat, salad, nuts, fats, and choline for focus

- If exercised hard, may ingest starches like oatmeal or rice and fruit

- Fasting can increase alertness, but if too hungry, it can lead to agitation

\24. Post Lunch Low/No Cognitive Load

- Around 2 or 3 p.m., start to feel groggy and sleepy

- Shift work to tasks that require less cognitive load

- Answer emails and other mundane tasks in and out of sequence

- Linear work and learning work requires more focus

- Around 4 p.m., do two things

\25. Hydration, NSDR, Nap

- Hydrate throughout the day

- Refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon

- Do a non-sleep deep rest protocol in the afternoon (e.g. yoga nidra, hypnosis)

- Set an alarm for no more than 90 minutes

- Emerge from the protocol feeling energized and ready to work

\26. Creativity Work

- Doing work that involves linear analysis or learning

- Utilizing non-sleep deep rest protocols to enhance and accelerate plasticity

- Caffeine-free learning bout in the clear, calm, and focus regime

- Creative discovery mode involves rearranging existing elements in novel ways

- Entire month dedicated to exploring creativity

\27. Creativity Is A Two-Part Phenomenon

- Creativity is a two-part process of actively exploring different configurations and then creating something robust and concrete.

- Creativity is best accessed in a relaxed and almost sleepy state, which is not accessible early in the day.

- Alertness is better for linear implementation and pursuing particular goals.

- Different people may be better at accessing creative states in the morning or afternoon.

- Substances can help access creative states, but not the linear implementation state.

\28. Psychedelics

- Psychedelics can be hazardous for people with preexisting psychological issues and for kids.

- Psychedelics are thought to unleash sensory processing and make it less filtered.

- Psychedelics can lead to more lateral connectivity between different brain areas, but this does not necessarily lead to creativity.

- Psychedelics may have a role in certain clinical contexts, provided it is done legally and safely.

- Creative works can be conceived in a relaxed state, but require high levels of alertness for implementation.

\29. Afternoon Light As Insurance

- Getting light in the morning and evening is important for maintaining a regular 24 hour cycle and optimizing learning and performance.

- Morning light advances the clock and evening light delays it.

- Minimize light exposure, especially overhead bright light exposure, from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.

- Screens off and dim lights in the evening to favor falling asleep.

\30. Evening Nutrition

- Evening meals tend to be carbohydrate-rich

- Proteins may include eggs, fish, or chicken

- Carbohydrates facilitate calmness and sleepiness

- Exercise early in the day requires glycogen replenishment

- Gluconeogenesis does not always allow for glycogen replenishment

\31. Repacking Glycogen: Hormonal Factors

- People who are proponents of high-meat keto diets may be hormone-enhanced, allowing them to replenish glycogen without carbohydrates

- People who follow ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep may have trouble with sleep due to autonomic arousal

- Eating carbohydrates in the evening can help replenish glycogen and maintain healthy thyroid function

- Avoiding caffeine and taking supplements in the evening can also help with sleep

\32. Pre-Sleep Anxiety: Normal and Easy To Solve

- Charles Zeisler's lab at Harvard Medical School has found that the peak of wakefulness and the suppression of the sleep signal happens late in the day.

- Body temperature is lowest right before waking and increases throughout the day until it falls in the evening.

- A brief blip of release of peptides and other substances from the sleep centers in the brain occurs about an hour before bedtime.

- Knowing about this blip of alertness can help people to use it to get organized for the next day.

\33. The Power of Objective Tools

- Changes in alertness and breathing tools can be used to shift autonomic arousal

- Fasting and caffeine can increase alertness

- Involves cortisol and epinephrine

- Physical activity early in the day can help with waking up

- Working out late in the day can cause difficulty falling asleep

- Activity and temperature can shift the body clock

\34. Visualization

- Visualization can help improve performance in certain activities

- Visualization is most effective when done in a sleepy state

- Some people are very good at visualization and can remain focused and linear

- Visualization is not effective for everyone

- Examples of using visualization to rehabilitate an injured limb exist, but are specialized circumstances

- Waking up and structuring the day is a normal way to approach visualization

\35. Mini-Synthesis

- Goes to sleep between 10:30 and 11:00 PM

- Has a period in the afternoon where they get sleepy

- Eats low carb during the day and higher carb in the evening

- Anticipates late night peak in alertness

- Wakes up periodically during sleep, which is normal

- Wakes up between 5:30 and 7:00 AM

\36. Resetting Your Clock

- Waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. is likely due to going to bed too late, rather than a sign of anxiety

- It is easier to stay up late than to wake up early

- A study from the University of Colorado found that people naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset and wake up around sunrise

- Melatonin release usually subsides by 3 or 4 a.m., which is why people may wake up at this time

- To facilitate sleep, people may take magnesium glycinate or magnesium threonate, or theanine

\37. Don’t Trust the Mind Now

- Don't trust thoughts in the middle of the night

- Dreams are rarely magnificent

- Use non-sleep deep rest protocols to turn off looping thinking and fall back asleep

\38. Two, (Maybe 3) Optimization Bouts Per Day

- There are two 90 minute bouts of learning and work in the morning and afternoon

- Other hours of the day are occupied by tasks such as email, Zoom meetings, reading, etc.

- These two 90 minute bouts are used to expand mental capacities

- It is important to slot in these brain optimization segments into the day in an intelligent way

- During these sessions, it is important to optimize them to get the most out of them

\39. Organizational Logic

- Optimizing learning and brain change is related to biological mechanisms such as the basal ganglia, go-no-go pathways, and the circadian autonomic system.

- Food and fasting can affect alertness and sleepiness.

- Linear focus and strategy implementation is best served by high alert states, while creative states are supported by states of relaxation or sleepiness.

- Circadian logic and biological mechanisms can be used to arrange one's routine.

\40. Wim Hof Breathing, Binaural Beats, Ice Baths, Etc.

- Tools to modulate or measure the nervous system can move you up or down the state of autonomic arousal, making you more alert or more calm, more focused or less focused.

- Cold showers, ice baths, super oxygenation, and Wim Hof type breathing can bring your level of alertness up, but caution should be taken.

- Binaural beats have been shown to shift the brain into particular states, but it is difficult to measure these states without EEG machines.

- Become an observer of your own system to determine what works best for you, and use tools that are anchored in biological mechanisms.

- Have a period of every 24-hour cycle when you tend to be more awake and a period when you tend to be more asleep.

- Leverage these periods with food, supplementation, and other protocols.

\41. Variation Among People, and Dogs

- Some people are naturally more active and some are calmer

- Autonomic nervous systems can be more geared towards parasympathetic calm states

- Bulldogs are very calm animals and make no spontaneous movements

- Pit bulls and other animals tend to ride at high levels of autonomic arousal

- People should know their own goals and strive for accuracy

\42. Accurate Versus Exhaustive

- The information provided was not exhaustive and there is more to explore in terms of optimizing learning and performance.

- The next episode will explore two essential aspects of neuroplasticity related to learning: pain management and neural regeneration.

- The discussion will include how to use top-down modulation to suppress pain response, hardwired mechanisms to control pain, and interactions between the pain system and the learning system.

- Costello had a long walk and may have been snoring in the background.

\3. Emotions, Addiction & Mindset

- This month's podcast is about the neuroscience of emotions, specifically motivation and reward.

- We will discuss pleasure, reward, addictions, and the neurochemistry of drive and mindset.

- Addiction will be discussed in its own month of the podcast with a special guest.

- Motivation is fundamental to our daily life and allows us to get out of bed in the morning.

\4. Motivation & Movement: The Dopamine Connection

- Motivation and movement are linked to the same molecule, dopamine.

- Acetylcholine is responsible for focus in the brain.

- Dopamine is responsible for the desire to overcome barriers.

- Dopamine is a double-edged blade, linked to both great and terrible aspects of life.

\5. A Double-Edged Dopamine Blade

- Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the world of neuroscience.

- Increasing dopamine is not always the right thing to do.

- Dopamine scheduling is a tool to help achieve goals and prevent quitting.

- Understanding the dopamine system can help leverage it to one's benefit.

- Tools discussed are applicable to people of all ages.

\6. Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor to Adrenalin

- Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s and is the precursor to epinephrine/adrenaline

- Epinephrine is responsible for stimulating changes in the body that bias us for movement

- Dopamine is not always converted to epinephrine and is released from several sites in the brain and body

- Dopamine is thought of as the molecule of reward and pleasure

- Dopamine does a lot of things on its own

\7. The Reward Pathway: An Accelerator & A Brake

- The reward pathway is important for motivation and can lead to addiction.

- It consists of the VTA (ventral tegmental area) and nucleus accumbens.

- The prefrontal cortex acts as a break on the dopamine system, allowing us to regulate our behavior.

- Without the prefrontal cortex, we would be purely pleasure-seeking animals.

- The reward pathway is important for understanding motivation.

\8. Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain

- Motivation is a two-part process that balances pleasure and pain.

- Dopamine is released in the brain when we experience things we like.

- Dopamine is responsible for wanting and craving, not just pleasure.

- Dopamine is released in anticipation and craving for a particular thing.

- Dopamine has the effect of narrowing our focus for the thing we crave.

\9. The Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine

- Dopamine firing increases in response to different things, such as food, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine

- Thinking about food, sex, nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamine increases dopamine levels

- Eating food increases dopamine levels by 50% above baseline

- Sex increases dopamine levels by 100% above baseline

- Nicotine increases dopamine levels by 150% above baseline

- Cocaine and amphetamine increase dopamine levels by 1000% within 10 seconds

\10. Subjective Control of Dopamine Release

- Brain circuitry evolved to motivate behaviors towards particular goals, such as water when thirsty and sex to reproduce.

- Hormones such as estrogen and testosterone can bias dopamine to be released.

- Drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine can release massive amounts of dopamine, creating closed loops where people only crave the drug.

- Most things do not release the same level of dopamine as drugs.

\11. Social Media and Video Games

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and in video games. And there have been some measurements of the amount of dopamine released. Video games, especially video games that have a very high update speed where there's novel territory all the time, novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine. Those can release dopamine somewhere between nicotine and cocaine. So very high levels of dopamine release. Social media is an interesting one because the amount of dopamine that's released in response to logging onto social media initially could be quite high, but it seems likely that there's a taper in the amount of dopamine, but and yet people still get addicted.

\12. Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

So why? Why is it that we can get addicted to things that fail to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure that they initially did? Being addicted to something isn't just about the fact that it feels so good that you want to do it over and over again. And that's because of this pleasure-pain balance that underlies motivation. So let's look a little bit closer at the pleasure-pain balance because therein lies the tools for you to be able to control motivation toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors towards things that are destructive for you.

\13. Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation

- People try novel behaviors for a variety of reasons, including drugs, adventure, new partners, and taking classes.

- Addiction to drugs like cocaine and amphetamine can be destructive.

- 15-20% of people have a genetic bias towards addiction.

- Dopamine is released when people anticipate and engage in a behavior.

- Repeatedly engaging in a behavior can lead to addiction.

\14. Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails

- Dopamine is not the only chemical released when experiencing pleasure, there is also a low-level sense of pain

- For every bit of pleasure, there is a mirror image experience of pain

- With each subsequent time of experiencing pleasure, the dopamine release and pleasure is diminished

- The amount of pain and craving for the pleasure increases over time

- Much of our pursuit of pleasure is to reduce the pain of craving

\15. Desire Scales With Pain: The Yearning Function

- Dopamine is not only about pleasure, but also about motivation and desire to pursue more in order to reduce the amount of pain.

- Pain can be both psychological and physical.

- Desire for something is proportional to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing, and how much pain is experienced when it is not available.

- Yearning is a valuable concept in this context, as it includes a whole body experience more than just wanting.

\16. The Croissant Craving Circuit

- Croissants are delicious and can make someone want to eat six.

- Impulse control is needed to experience the taste of the croissant.

- Satiety and satisfaction are related to neuromodulators such as serotonin, oxytocin, and prolactin.

- These are discussed in the book The Molecule of More.

\17. “Here and Now” Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

your sensations and pleasure in the present and for which the brain stops projecting into the future. So now let's talk about craving and these so-called here and now molecules and how those engage in a kind of push-pull balance that will allow you to not just feel more motivated, but also to enjoy the things in life that you are pursuing to a much greater degree. We have neurons in an area of our brain called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E. The raphe releases serotonin at different places in the brain. Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment for what you already have. I've talked before about exteroception. Exteroception is a focus on the outside world,

\18. In Your Skin Or Out In the World

- Dopamine and serotonin can be thought of as related to exteroception and interoception, respectively.

- Dopamine makes us focused on things outside our personal space.

- Serotonin has to do with the things that are in our immediate here and now.

- Dopamine biases us toward thinking about what we don't have.

- Serotonin and endocannabinoids help us focus on the present.

\19. Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness

- Cannabis attaches to endocannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids are chemicals that naturally occur in the body

- Pot smokers may have impaired memories due to the effects of cannabis

- Endocannabinoid receptors exist in the body to bind to natural endogenous cannabinoids

- Push-pull system of endocannabinoid receptors and cannabinoids creates a feeling of contentment

- Meditation practice is suggested to help with this system

\20. The Almond Meditation

- Mindfulness practice involves focusing on one almond and being present in the moment

- Normally, feeding is driven by dopamine, but mindfulness shifts this to serotonin and the cannabinoid system

- Mindfulness is a vast space and can give deeper appreciation for what you already have

\21. Drugs That Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception

- Dopamine makes people pursue things, while drugs like marijuana and opioids make people lethargic and content.

- THC can increase appetite due to its effects on insulin and blood sugar.

- A healthy emotional landscape requires a balance between dopamine and molecules that make people content with what they have.

\22. Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation

- People who are always in anticipation and desire and seeking can be difficult to be around.

- People with high levels of dopamine release in their brain can manipulate to get what they want.

- Dopamine doesn't care how you reach your goals, only that you reach them.

- People can pursue goals actively or passively.

- Dopamine brings a mild pleasure, but can also bring pain if goals are not reached.

\23. Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, Prescription Drugs

- There are two types of procrastinators: those who enjoy the stress of a deadline and those who don't release enough dopamine.

- To increase dopamine levels, one can use breathing techniques, caffeine, L-tyrosine, or antidepressants.

- It is important to consult a doctor before taking any supplements or medications to increase dopamine levels.

- High levels of dopamine can create a sense of pleasure and the desire for more.

\24. When Enough Is Never Enough; How Dopamine Undermines Itself

- Dopamine wants more of the thing that releases it

- Growth mindset and positive mindsets can help attach dopamine to the process of pursuing goals

- Supplementation and prescription drugs can increase dopamine, but also increase the pain of lack of accomplishment

- There are mechanisms in place to put a break on dopamine

- Navigating dopamine crashes can lead to healthier dopamine schedules and more motivation

\25. Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods

- Neural circuitry is designed for seeking out mates and reproduction in all humans

- Dopamine is released on anticipation and consummation of sex and reproduction

- After orgasm, there is a decrease in dopamine and an increase in the hormone prolactin

- Prolactin creates a sense of lethargy and lack of desire to pursue more of whatever released the dopamine

- Prolactin sets the refractory period on a male's ability to mate again, varying from individual to individual

\26. The Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression of Prolactin

- The release of dopamine is increased by novelty, which was first shown in an experiment with chickens (the Coolidge effect).

- The introduction of a novel mate increases dopamine levels and shortens the refractory period.

- Prolactin increases after copulation and prevents further copulation, but can be suppressed by drugs or Vitamin B6.

- This story applies to humans as well as chickens.

\27. Vitamin B6, Zinc As Mild Prolactin Inhibitors

- Vitamin B6 and zinc are often used as “testosterone boosters”, but they actually work by inhibiting prolactin and increasing dopamine.

- Hyperprolactinemia can lead to decreased libido and there are prescription drugs to treat it.

- The dopamine and prolactin system evolved for reproduction, but can be seen in other areas of the world.

\28. Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity and Side Effects of Anti-Dopaminergic Drugs

- Schizophrenia is a disease that is caused by hyperactivation of the dopamine system.

- Treatment for schizophrenia includes drugs that block dopamine receptors.

- Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder caused by anti-dopaminergic drugs.

- Gynecomastia (male breast tissue) is caused by elevated levels of prolactin due to the suppression of dopamine.

- Face and body writhing behaviors are side effects of drugs used to treat mental illness.

\29. Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction “Lows” & Extending the Arc of Dopamine

- Prolactin is released after intense experiences, and is thought to be responsible for postpartum depression and other types of let down.

- Dopamine release varies from person to person, and can be extended cognitively.

- Vitamin B6 can be taken to offset the low feeling after a major event, but should be taken with caution.

- High performers can extend pleasure without having to engage in the behavior over and over.

\30. The Chemistry of “I Won, But Now What?”

- Many people who have achieved something big struggle to exceed it

- People who are very driven and motivated are prone to addiction and neglecting internal mechanisms

- Practices such as mindfulness and getting a good night's sleep can help to balance pleasure-seeking and offsetting of pain

- Pleasure is both joy in pursuit and joy in what you have

- Alan Shore developed a model of emotional development

\31. Healthy Emotional Development: Child and Parent

- Good parenting leads to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation

- Relationship between child and parent is key

- Parenting should involve both exciting and calming activities

- Exciting activities involve anticipation of something coming (dopaminergic system)

- Calming activities involve engaging with the child in the present moment (serotonin system)

- At-risk kids need special attention and care

\32. Never Say “Maybe” (Reward Prediction Error)

- Saying "maybe" to a kid about a reward is not effective, as they don't hear the "maybe" part.

- Reward prediction error is the difference between the actual amount of dopamine released in response to something and the amount expected.

- If something is expected but doesn't happen, it leads to a big crash in dopamine and a feeling of pain.

- Adults are also affected by reward prediction error.

- The "maybe" is an important part of our biology, as it encourages exploration of novel territories.

\33. Surprise!

- Dopamine is released when we experience something positive, such as a surprise letter from someone we haven't thought about in a long time.

- This dopamine release triggers neural plasticity, making the experience memorable.

- Dopamine is also released when we experience something negative.

- We can regulate the dopamine system to create more positive anticipation and less disappointment.

- This is done by adjusting the dopamine schedule.

\34. Are You Suppressing Your Drive and Motivation By Working Too Late?

- Viewing bright light from 10pm to 4am too often triggers activation of the habenula, which suppresses reward circuitry.

- This reduces capacity to release dopamine, not just in that moment, but to things that are normally positively anticipated and pursued.

- Light in the middle of the night is a kind of antagonist, blocking dopamine.

- Tips to bypass dopamine suppression can be found in the episode about jet lag and shift work.

- To understand how to control the dopamine system, listen to the podcast.

\35. Disambiguating Pleasure and Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy

- An experiment was conducted to separate pleasure from motivation, using rats

- Rats with dopamine neurons were able to move one body length to the lever to get food, while rats without dopamine neurons did not

- Dopamine is not about the ability to experience pleasure, but about motivation for pleasure

- Low levels of dopamine can lead to procrastination and lack of motivation

- Treatment for low dopamine levels can include prescription drugs, psychotherapy, and other treatments

\36. Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine

- Compound in supplement space is beta-phenethylamine (PEA)

- Releases low levels of dopamine and serotonin

- People report feeling heightened sense of mental acuity and wellbeing

- Stimulant-like effects due to activation of dopamine and norepinephrine pathways

- Check with healthcare provider before taking

- More info available on examine.com

\37. Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity

- Acetyl L-carnitine is a prescription drug in Europe and an over-the-counter drug in the US

- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) are clinical diagnoses

- Context switching is bad for the brain and can lead to clinical ADHD/ADD

- Drugs like Adderall activate the forebrain circuitry and reduce impulsivity

- Impulsivity at age 10 is predictive of overeating disorders later in life

\38. Leveraging Dopamine Schedules

- Dopamine schedules can be used to increase motivation and pleasure in life.

- Dopamine is subjective and can be controlled to some extent.

- An experiment was described to highlight the power of subjective interpretation of an experience.

\39. Subjective Control of Dopamine and Drug Effects: The “Adderall” Experiment

- A study was conducted on 65 undergraduate students to examine the effects of expectation on caffeine consumption

- The students were randomized to either placebo or 200 milligrams of caffeine and told they were either getting caffeine or Adderall

- The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling more stimulated, anxious, and motivated than the subjects that received the placebo

- The subjects expecting Adderall reported stronger amphetamine effects, better performance on a working memory test, and increased cognitive effects

- The study suggests that higher level cognitive processes can positively impact basic physiological processes, such as dopamine release

\40. Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills Them

- Caffeine can increase dopamine release in the brain by about 30% and may have a protective effect on dopamine neurons.

- MDMA (ecstasy) has not been shown to destroy dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in any published studies.

- Amphetamine and methamphetamine are very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.

- Nicotine has not been studied in terms of its effect on dopamine neurons.

\41. Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase

- Smoking is bad for health and can lead to lung cancer

- Nobel Prize winning scientist chews Nicorette

- Nicotine can stimulate dopamine release

- Protective effects of nicotine may be through noradrenergic and acetylcholine systems

- Nicotine can increase prolactin when taken in excess over long periods of time

\42. Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad and Good)

- Gambling works because of the hope and anticipation it provides, leveraging the dopamine system.

- Gambling addiction is particularly sinister because the next time could change everything.

- Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form of dopamine reward schedule to keep people doing something.

- We can use this knowledge to pursue goals in life and remain on the path to that goal for a long time.

- Exceeding previous performance is possible by leveraging the dopamine system.

\43. Intermittent Halting of Celebration; Enjoy Your Wins, But Not All of Them

- Celebrate wins, but don't celebrate every win to avoid dopamine crash

- Blunt reward response for intermediate goals

- Take reward out of your own hands and have someone else control it

- Make reward intermittent and unpredictable

- Self-reward is important, but don't do it on a predictable schedule

\44. A Story Example of Intermittent Reward to Maintain Long-Term Drive and Motivation

- Graduate advisor Barbara Chapman instilled the idea that the work itself should be the most rewarding

- She also put the student on an intermittent reward schedule for wins

- This has served the student well in their scientific career and other aspects of life

- The student is now cautious with how they deploy dopamine release in response to wins

- Intermittent reward for achievements is a powerful way to stay on the path of pursuit
