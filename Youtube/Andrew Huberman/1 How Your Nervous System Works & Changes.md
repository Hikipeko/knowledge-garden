##### Perception

* Perception is our ability to take what we're sensing and focus on it, and make sense of it, to explore it, to remember it. 
* Perception is whichever sensations we happen to be paying attention to at any moment.
* Humans have two attentional spotlights, allowing us to multitask.

##### Reflexive and Deliberate

- Our nervous system has two components: reflexive and deliberate.
- Reflexive action is bottom-up processing, meaning information is flowing in through our senses and directing our activity.
- Deliberate action is top-down processing, meaning we are actively looking around and thinking in a deliberate way.

##### Emotions

- Neuromodulators are chemicals that have a profound influence on our emotional states, such as dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and epinephrine.
- Neuromodulators can bias which neurons are active and which are inactive, creating a certain mood.
- Dopamine is a molecule of motivation, while serotonin is a molecule of contentment.
- Emotions are contextual and reflexive, not under our control.

##### Thought and Actions

- Thoughts are like perceptions, drawing on the present, past, and future.
- Our nervous system is devoted to converting sensations, perceptions, feelings, and thoughts into actions.

##### Control Our Impulses

* Top-down processing is the forebrain's ability to suppress behavior and speech.
* Suppressing behavior and speech can cause agitation due to the release of norepinephrine.
* This agitation is known as limbic friction and is caused by the tug-of-war between the limbic system and the frontal cortex.

##### Neuroplasticity

- Neuroplasticity is the ability for neurons to change their connections in response to experience.
- It requires top-down processing and feeling of agitation and strain.
- Neuroplasticity is most effective in young people (25), but adults can still direct their own neural changes.
- Neuroplasticity is gated and controlled by neuromodulators.
- Neuroplasticity is triggered by epinephrine and requires alertness and focus.
- ==Rewiring of the nervous system occurs during periods of sleep and non-sleep deep rest (20 min).==
- Deep rest is important for consolidating changes in the nervous system.

##### Leveraging Ultradian Cycles

* The autonomic nervous system is composed of the sympathetic (alertness) and parasympathetic (calmness) systems.
- Pay attention to the rhythms of your waking states to optimize focus and reflexive thinking.
- The most important ultradian rhythm is the ==90 minute cycle which governs focus and attention==.
- The brain is not optimally tuned for focus and attention in the first 5-10 minutes of the cycle, but improves as the cycle progresses.
