Sleep is a period of our lives where we are not conscious and is important for resetting our ability to be focused, alert, and emotionally stable.

##### Neural Modulators

* Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body that builds up the longer we are awake, creating a sleep drive or hunger.
* Staying up longer than usual increases adenosine levels and makes people very sleepy.
* Cortisol is released from the adrenal glands when we wake up, which increases heart rate, muscle tension, and alertness.
* A timer is set in the body when cortisol is released, which dictates when melatonin will be released from the pineal gland 12-14 hours later.
* Norepinephrine and epinephrine are also released, which can be increased by stressors throughout the day.
* Melatonin is the hormone that makes us sleepy and is only released from the pineal gland.

##### Caffeine

- Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist, blocking the sleepiness receptor and making us feel more alert.
- When the caffeine wears off, adenosine binds to the receptor, causing a crash and making us feel especially tired.

##### Timing your Sleep Properly

- Our sleep and alertness is governed by two forces: adenosine and a circadian force.
- The circadian force is a 24-hour clock in our brain that determines when we want to be sleepy and when we want to be awake.

##### Light

- Light entering the eyes through the retinal ganglion cells is what determines when cortisol starts to rise.
- The retina is two pieces of the brain that reside outside the skull and perceive light.
- Bright light exposure early in the day is key to setting and anchoring the circadian clock.
- ==Sunlight should be viewed as close to waking as possible, and for at least 30-60 seconds.==
- Get bright light early in the day from sunlight, or from artificial light if necessary.
- Half of those who think they are night owls may just not be getting enough sunlight early in the day.
- ==Viewing sunlight around the time of sunset can help protect against the negative effects of light later in the day.==
- Exposure to artificial light at night can have negative effects.
- Avoid bright light exposure to eyes between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., use low and dim light.

##### Others

- Restricting feeding to a certain period of each 24-hour cycle is best.
- How to wake up earlier? Bright light exposure before waking up can phase advance your clock, making you want to wake up earlier.
- NSDR can provide wakefulness, emotional stability, and better sleep.
- Neurostimulator-directed reset (NSDR) is a type of meditation that can reset the brain's ability to engage in deliberate activities.
