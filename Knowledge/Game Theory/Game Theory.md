## Week 1

**Self-interested**

The agent has its own description of states of the world that it likes, and acts based on this description.

**Utility function**

Quantifies degree of preference across alternatives.

**Game**

Players + actions + payoffs (motivation)

**Normal Form**

Players move simultaneously.

**Extensive Form**

Players move sequentially.

**Prisoner's dilemma**

|      | C    | D    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| C    | a, a | b, c |
| D    | c, b | d, d |

c > a > d > b

**Games of Pure Competition**
$$
u_1(a) + u_2(a) = c
$$
rock, papers, and scissors

**Games of Cooperation**

Players have exactly the same interests.

### Nash Equilibrium

Each player's action maximizes his payoff given the actions of the others.

**Keynes Beauty Contest Game**

Each player names an integer between 1 and 100.

The player who names the integer closest to 2/3 of the average integer wins.

Nash equilibrium: every player announce 1.

**Domination**

Action A dominates action B if u(A) is greater than u(B) in any situation.

**Dominant**

The strategy dominates all others.

In prisoners' dilemma, D is the dominant.

**Pareto Optimality**

If outcome A is at least as good for every agent as another outcome B, then A Pareto-dominates B.

An outcome A is Pareto-optimal if there is no other outcome that Pareto-dominates it.

Every game have at least one Pareto-optimal outcome.



## Week 2

**Mixed strategies**

Move than one action is played with positive probability.

Use the idea of expected utility.

**Theorem**

Every finite game has a Nash equilibrium.

e.g. 0.5, 0.5 for the matching pennies
